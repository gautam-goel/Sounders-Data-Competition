# Sounders-Data-Competition

This is a project for the 2020 Sounders FC Soccer Analytics Competition. We created a positional profile visualization tool for player scouting using Statsbomb, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The player_profiles.py contains code for scraping and formatting event data from the OpenData Statsbomb Repository. The player_visuals.py contains code for creating charts and heat maps of event daya using the above python libraries.
